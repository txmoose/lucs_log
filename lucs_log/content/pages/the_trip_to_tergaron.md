### 7xxx, 12-17 Alturiak, The Claw of Winter

The trip was long and, I wish I could say "arduous", but with the money that Erik The Red provided us, very comfortable. We traveled North through the Mountain Pass, through very industrial, harsh, angular cities. The people were not cold like the architecture, but they weren't exactly the most hospitable people. After the pass, we spent time traveling the Great Crossroads of the Dunn. It was quite the experience! Most people there seem to just be trying to scrape together whatever gold they can "obtain" from others traveling the road.

The bazzars and oceans of people eventually gave way to the mountains of the Air Region. This road, I'm sure, was the only safe way for anyone who is not of Air lineage to cross the region. It was refreshing to finally come to the Life Region with its impossibly massive forests that seemed to begin as soon as the mountains ended. There was even much less traffic here, but that could be attributed to the locals being much more comfortable amongst the trees rather than on the road. I can say, I did feel... _stares_ and judgement from some of the _full_ blood elves, but my new companions softened that blow considerably.

At the far end of the Life Region, we chartered a ferry across the Water Region and it's beautiful, warm, tropical islands. I never thought I'd consider staying anywhere outside my home Earth Region, but the thought certainly crossed my mind. It could be a wonderful new home after this adventuring is done.

I was sad to be off the ferry, but adventure (and paying jobs) must press on.  And press on we did through the Earth Region's rolling hills and forever-expanding plains. Our destination is near the border with the harsh deserts of the Fire Region, and we'll be arriving in town after breakfast tomorrow morning.
