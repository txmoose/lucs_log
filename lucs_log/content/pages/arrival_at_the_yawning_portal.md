### 7xxx, 11 Alturiak, The Claw of Winter

After the frankly arduous journey to Phy'la in the heart of the Death Region, I’m disappointed to find that this flyer promising adventure at the Yawning Portal Tavern is... _less_ than I'd hoped. The tavern was mostly empty, save for a curious man who seemed to very much enjoy throwing people down a large hole after swindling gold from them. I believe I overheard him introduce himself as Durnan, but that could be entirely incorrect.

And he did, in fact, swindle a couple other individuals and myself into the great pit for which I assume the tavern is named. It was deceptively deep, so much so that an elven paladin still at the bar didn’t or couldn’t hear when a trio of Aarakocra assaulted an interesting lizard man, a single minded wooden man, and myself.

It was a terrifying fight, with both of my newfound compatriots being incapacitated and I very nearly so. The new spell I recently worked out was, situationally, the perfect tool for this encounter, and I’m pleased to see my iteration of a Sleep spell work as effectively as a clerics! I fully believe our combined usage of the similar spells saved our lives. The single minded wooden man, a cleric of the Twilight Order, provided me a protection spell, and after being incapacitated himself miraculously rebounded to conclude the hostilities.

Upon our unlikely victory, we were hoisted back into the tavern. The curious lizard man pretty much immediately found himself mesmerised by the the roaring fire place without as much as a word to the rest of us. **MAGUS** - Magical Acolyte, the Galaxies Umbral Star - seemed to deem us a party at this point, as we had endured combat together, and at this point I am glad to accept the companionship. The elven paladin, Voramon, didn’t immediately scorn me as a half breed, and even seemed friendly.

The three of us at the bar came to understand each other some until a mountain of a man named Erik The Red entered the tavern. **MAGUS** seemed solely fixed upon completing a promise made to a fellow cleric on his deathbed which hinged upon speaking to this Erik The Red.  Erik seemed a less than pleased to see us, though.

Erik was forthright in letting us know that we were not the crew he was expecting, but he did offer us some work after a brief discussion. I believe the exact phrase he used was, "I could use some warm bodies to throw at _things_." As hostile as that sounds, it turns out that there is a small town known as Tergaron in The Pale Wastes far to the North and West that Erik is interested in learning some secrets about. He did not really give us more than that. I am honestly unable to tell if he is testing us or truly has no idea into what he is sending us.

After some discussion, it seems everyone is on board with pursuing this job, especially with the prospect of more work on the other end of this job and the very casual way in which Erik provided us enough money to charter comfortable travel across the whole of the known map.

The crew shared a _shockingly_ good dinner from... a barrel... bucket? On a ... shield? This tavern is incredibly confusing to me. And I'm fairly certain I overpaid for a room after the abuse I suffered at the hands of Durnan, but it was a very comfortable room. I was able to get a good night's sleep, which is the first I've had since beginning this ~~journ~~ _Adventure_.
