### 1490, 11 Alturiak, The Claw of Winter

After the frankly arduous journey to Waterdeep, I’m disappointed to find that this flyer promising adventure at the Yawning Portal Tavern is exaggerating a bit. Or a lot. The tavern was mostly empty, save for a curious man who seemed to very much enjoy throwing people down a large hole after swindling gold from them. I believe I overheard him introduce himself as Durnan, but that could be entirely incorrect. 

And he did, in fact, swindle a couple other individuals and myself into the great pit for which I assume the tavern is named.  It was deceptively deep, so much so that an elven paladin still at the bar didn’t or couldn’t hear when a trio of Aarakocra assaulted an interesting lizard man, a single minded wooden man, and myself. 

It was a terrifying fight, with both of my newfound compatriots being incapacitated and I very nearly so. The new spell I recently worked out was, situationally, the perfect tool for this encounter, and I’m pleased to see my iteration of a Sleep spell work as effectively as a clerics! I fully believe our combined usage of the similar spells saved our lives. The single minded wooden man, a cleric of the Twilight Order, provided me a protection spell, and after being incapacitated himself miraculously rebounded to conclude the hostilities. 

Upon being hoisted back into the tavern, the curious lizard man pretty much immediately found himself a nap near the roaring fire place without as much as a word to the rest of us. MAGUS - Magical Acolyte, the Galaxies Umbral Star - seemed to deem us a party at this point, as we had endured combat together, and at this point I am glad to accept the companionship. The elven paladin, Voramon, didn’t immediately scorn me as a half breed, and even seemed friendly.

The three of us still awake came to understand each other some until a mountain of a man named Eric The Red entered the tavern. MAGUS seemed solely fixed upon completing a promise made to a fellow cleric on his deathbed which hinged upon speaking to this Erik The Red.
