### 7xxx, 17 Alturiak, The Claw of Winter

As much as I enjoyed the sights and sounds of the world, I believe my favorite aspect of this trip has been getting to know my companions. **MAGUS** is a Twilight Cleric. His body is that of a full grown man, but his experience is that of a child. He views the world in ways that I haven't in years, and he brings such an interesting perspective to any interaction in which he is a participant. Voramon, while being a full blood high elf does not carry the disdain for me that I am accustomed to receiving. He hasn't said much to us, but he is generous with his money, food, and support. I ... look forward to getting to know him more and how he came to be a paladin. The most _interesting_ of the group, though, is Sharzar. He is a lizardfolk from the Fire Region, and is delightfully unaware of societal norms. Honestly, I look forward to seeing him confound the next merchant, barkeep, or traveler that he interacts with. I'm learning so much from him about Lizardfolk society, as well! He does't even seem to have the concept of witholding information or telling falsehoods. It is wonderful. I can not wait to have more to write about everyone!
